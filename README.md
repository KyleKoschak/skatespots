# SkateSpots

## Description
SkateSpots is an Android app utilizing Google Maps and Firebase Storage/Realtime Databse. Users
of the app can place markers on the map for where there is a spot they wish to add to the database.

## Basic Usage
To add a spot to the map the user must be near the spot and an image of the spot is required. This
limits the amount of fake spots that are located on the map.

The spots can be filtered in realtime based on the type of spot and/or specific keywords that you are 
looking for.
